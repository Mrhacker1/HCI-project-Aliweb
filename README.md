# Project Title: Aliweb Remake

We have embarked on a project to revamp a website search engine known as Aliweb. This platform allows users to discover websites they wish to visit, categorized for their convenience.

# working of the website

1. To start, simply open the aliweb.html file in a web browser.
2. You can type in the name of sub-category (that is the name form the list that you get when you hover each category. Ex: when I hover over 'computing': I get a list, browser, CGI/Java, Companies..etc, you can type in any name from the list of any catogery) and click enter. This will open the list of websites in particular category.
3. you can also hover a category and click on any sub_category from the list. this too will open the list of websites in the particular category.
4. Once you are in a page of sub-category lists containing the website, you can click to website name to go to the website (for instance, when you hover over 'Computing' category, and click on 'browsers' sub-category it will take you to a list of websites in that category, click on any website that you want to visit.) 
5. when ever you click the logo of the "Aliweb", in which ever page you be, it takes you back to home page (ofcourse this will not work when you are in home page)
6. In homepage, you can also enter your email, and click on subscribe for the email to be registered for our system.

# Additional Remarks
Our design for this website is significantly simpler than the current Aliweb search website, enhancing user-friendliness and accessibility.
